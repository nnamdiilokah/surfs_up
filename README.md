**Performing Weather Analysis Using SQLite, SQAlchemy and Python**

  ## Overview of Project
  The purpose of this project is to carry out an analysis using SQLite and SQAlchemy to gather June and December temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii for a potential investor who wants to establish a surf shop. The potential investor requires this statistics in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

  To perform this analysis, the following steps will be carried out:

  + Run two separate queries to retrieve all temperature data for the months of June and December.
  + Store the retrieved temperature for June and December in a list.
  + Create a DataFrame from the list of temperatures.
  + Generate the summary statistics for June and December temperatures.

  ## Results
   Our analysis provided three key differences in weather between June and December

   Summary Statistics for June temperatures is shown in the image below:

  + The month of June has higher mean temperature than the month of December. June has a mean temperature of 74.94 degrees whereas the month of December has a lower mean temperature of 71.04 degrees.

  + December has a lower maximum and minimum temperature compared to the month of June. December's maximu temperature was 2 degrees less than June's maximum temperature of 85 degrees.  Also, December's minimum temperature of 56 degees is 8 degrees less than the June minimum temperature of 64 degrees.
 
  + When comparing standard deviations, there is approximately 0.5 difference between the two months. June resulted in a standard deviation of 3.257 compared to December's standard deviation of 3.746.
